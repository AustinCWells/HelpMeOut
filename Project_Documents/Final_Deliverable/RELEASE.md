PAYPAL IS NOT WORKING ON THE BETA SITE. We emulated their service This is so you can buy
as many tokens as you want and use the website while not having to pay. (If we didn't emulate
the service you would HAVE to pay as there would be no way to exit the screen without paying).

On the My jobs page, if you get job offers and request (or people cancel the job on you) 
you have to refresh the page to see these changes.

The only github commit we couldn't finish was jobs don't expire because how we set the 
deadline time and date as separate fields. This was such a last minute problem we don't 
even know whose fault it was (DB or GUI).

Everything else on the website is ready to use! Enjoy the website!
