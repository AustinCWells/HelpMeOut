							3/27 - Updates:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STRUCTURE:
- Rearranged order of columns in USER for readbility
- Corrected issue where beggar/chooser were switched
	- Beggar is now required and Chooser can be null (before offer is accepted)
- Added "is_hidden" to USER per Raley's comments about how we are going to 
	manage which users have been hidden on the system (because they were 
	reported # times)
- Restructured OFFERS and added "offer_id" for usability


CONTENT:
- Added sample data to the following tables:
	- USER: Added one user for each team member with their correct @smu.edu
		email address and a password of 'password' followed single digit #
	- USER_DATA: Added content for each user's profile
	- TASK: Added sample tasks for each job category
		- These tasks as 'simple' in the sense that they are not time
			sensitive, they are not negotiable
		- These tasks are not marked as complete
	- REPORT: Added one sample report
	- BADGES: Gave each user at least one badge
	- OFFERS: Added sample offers
		- Two offers have been accepted (see TASK)
		- One offer has been accepted and is complete (see TASK)
